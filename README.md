Beginner‑Projects 🔰

What is this?
A collection of small, standalone Python programs — simple scripts meant for practice, learning, and experimentation. Think of it as a sandbox for beginners or anyone wanting to revisit basic Python concepts.

Included projects
Some of the example scripts are:

99Bottles.py — a fun script based on the “99 Bottles of Beer” song logic

coinEstimator.py — utility to estimate coin counts from a given weight

magic8Ball.py — a Magic 8‑Ball style random answer generator

pythagTriples.py — script that generates Pythagorean triples

And more small utility‑style or logic‑challenge Python scripts

Purpose & Audience

✅ Great for beginners wanting to practise basic Python syntax and logic

✅ Useful for learning Git/GitHub workflows — fork the repo, make changes, commit, push — no pressure

✅ Handy for quick experimentation, tinkering, or building on top of simple examples

How to use it

Fork the repository to your GitHub account

Clone it locally:

git clone https://github.com/<your‑username>/Beginner‑Projects.git


Pick a script (e.g. magic8Ball.py), open it, and run:

python3 magic8Ball.py


Try modifying the script — change logic, add new features, or convert to a small project of your own

Suggested improvements / contributions

Add more small/practice scripts (e.g. CLI tools, games, helpers)

Group scripts into folders (e.g. games/, utils/, math/) for better organization

Add docstrings or README entries per script explaining what each script does and how to run it

Consider adding some tests or simple usage examples to deepen understanding
